  <p> Why Digital Media? </p>
  <p> I chose digital media because I never really knew art could be digital, so I decided to learn more about it. In this class, I found many new friends and have worked on countless projects, overlapping my life with techniques of digital media. A good example is when I used leading lines for a picture on my Instagram collage, a technique where the underlying detail would be a collection of lines that followed the same direction./p>

    <p2> Here are some of the projects I've done in this class</p2>
  <br><p3> Project #1, Logo project:

  <br> In this mood board project, I decided to use Nike as my target brand because I love Nike and their products. I decided to add their sponsors, as well as some of their products as well. This created a nice vibe for the brand, showing off everything that they've accomplished <br> Project #2:</p3>

    For this project, I looked at the items I had around me and created a logo for each of them. I had a banana that I was eating as well as some pencils. I created a logo for each of them, (Only included pencils for space) and I think they turned out pretty well for a first try. <br> Project #3:

    For my next "logo" I decided to refer back to my mood board project and tried my best to replicate a pseudo logo for Nike. I would use the same swoosh of the Nike logo, but I would use a different color scheme - a gradient for the swoosh. <br> Project #4:
  <img src= "Egle.svg"
    <lb>Finally, I would make a logo for a college sports team. I looked up different logos and found myself on the eagle logo. I would replicate it in photoshop and use the same color scheme as well, the largest difference being that it's mostly composed of straight lines <br> Project #5:
      <br><img src="Firefly on the stage, show the man speaking in front of the crowd with someone else on the stage 911.jpg"
   <p6> <br> What inspired me to make this AI art was because of my attempt to run for president of sophomores (Miserable fail). I wanted to illustrate how the process worked for me in the form of AI art as well as a comic strip <br> Project #6 </p6>
    <br> <img src="Instagram collage copy.jpg" width="700" height="400">
    <br><p6>Here, we had to gather some of the pictures we took in the scavenger hunt and put them together in a collage. I used what could make sense to me; 4 pictures spelling out "cool" as a description of my school as well as our school colors. Thanks to photoshop, I was able to add certain effects tot the pictures as well. I made the school colors contrast with each other. I also thought it would be cool to make the letters white and black so it could accompany the contrasting colors alongside it.<br> Project #7:</p6>
    
    <br> <img src="IMG_0498.JPG" width="600" height="400">
    <br><p7>This was just a fun do now that we had. Here, I took a picture of my friend Harison using the rule of thirds which I thought looked cool.</p7>
  <br><p8> <br> Overall, in digital media I had a great time between taking pictures of my friends using rules I never knew existed and coding. I would say a lot of my time in digital media was spent understanding and applying the rules by doing the photography itself. A lot of time was also spent on photoshop altering the pictures that I took, which was a valuable tool for me.</p8>
  <p9><br>Thank you Mr Zheng! (I know I'm your fav student by far)</p9>
